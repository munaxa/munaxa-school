# Munaxa — Architecture Documentation (Phase 0)

> **Munaxa** is a multi-tenant **School Operating System (School OS)** for K-12 schools in Jordan.
> It is **not** an LMS — it integrates with Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams via deep links only.

This directory is the **binding architectural blueprint** produced in **Phase 0**. All later
phases (1–15) must conform to the decisions recorded here. Nothing here is implementation code;
it is design, diagrams (Mermaid), and strategy.

## Core principles (non-negotiable)

- **Domain Driven Design** + **Clean Architecture**.
- **Multi-tenancy**: shared PostgreSQL, every business row carries `tenantId`, hard isolation.
- **Strict RBAC** across Platform and School role sets.
- **Security first**: OWASP Top 10, JWT + refresh tokens, rate limiting, audit logging, TLS,
  DTO/input validation, secure uploads. **No secrets in code** — environment variables only.
- **Localization**: Arabic + English, RTL + LTR throughout.
- **Jordan market**: National ID (Raqam Watani), MoE student number, CliQ + e-wallet receipt
  uploads. **No online payment gateways.**
- **Strict TypeScript**, production-ready code, tests (unit + integration), Swagger docs.
