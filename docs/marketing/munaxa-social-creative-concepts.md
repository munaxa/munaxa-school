# Munaxa Social Image Prompts

Each creative below is copy-paste ready. Every prompt includes the Munaxa logo reference, theme tokens, typography, exclusions, visual direction, and platform sizing.

## Brand & Design Reference

These creatives reproduce the **Munaxa platform UI**, so they pull from the same design-system
source of truth as the product. Keep them in sync with the Munaxa palette,
[`platform/themes/school/palette.css`](../../../platform/themes/school/palette.css), the brand
hexes in [`platform/themes/school/brand.ts`](../../../platform/themes/school/brand.ts), and the
brand assets in [`docs/design-system/`](../design-system/README.md). If the code and a prompt ever
disagree, the code wins.

- **Logo:** [`docs/design-system/logo.png`](../design-system/logo.png) — the transparent, stylised
  ibex in the brand gradient (coral horns → violet base). Reference it by this repo-relative path.
  Never recolor, crop, distort, redraw, or make it mascot-like; scale by height so the ratio holds
  and place it on a plain surface (never on top of the gradient).
- **Surfaces (dark theme — used for all ads):** background `#0B0518`, elevated `#140A2E`,
  card `#1A0F38`, secondary card `#221547`.
- **Brand & accents:** primary violet `#7A3FFF`, light violet `#B97BFF`, coral `#FF8E6E`,
  aqua `#4DF4E1`. Primary gradient `linear-gradient(135deg, #7A3FFF, #B97BFF 60%, #FF8E6E 120%)` —
  reserved for primary actions, active nav, and the logo only.
- **Text:** foreground `#F4F0FF`, muted `#B5ACD4`, dim `#8B83A8`.
- **Typography:** Sora-like display headline, Inter-like body, JetBrains Mono-like numerics
  (numbers, IDs, money). Money is mono, 3-dp JOD, and stays LTR.
- **Bilingual:** EN/AR, RTL-aware layout; numbers, money, IDs, and dates stay LTR inside RTL.
- **Always exclude:** stock photos, children, classrooms, chalkboards, books, graduation caps, and
  any LMS/course-screen imagery. Munaxa is a **School Operating System, not an LMS**.
